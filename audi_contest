                <p class="margin_20">You will be provided with a 6ft tall, pre-lit, synthetic Christmas tree. All you need are the ornaments and your team!</p>
                
                <h5 class="things_to_know">Suggested team size</h5>
                <p class="margin_20">While we have no team minimum or maximum, we suggest you bring 4-8 tree decorators due to limited space between trees.</p>

                <ul class="margin_20">
                    <li>
                        Bring a minimum of 80-100 ornaments with you. While some may be branded, remember that this tree will be going into a deserving Calgarians home. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We suggest you bring a step stool with you to make sure every inch of the tree is decorated!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fun outfits are also encouraged.

                <h5 class="things_to_know">Corporate & Donation Gift Cards</h5>
                <p class="margin_20">Make your corporate Christmas gifts easy and pick up some gift cards to the CORE while you're here! You can order them ahead of time when you register. They'll be packaged and ready to go at Guest Services when you arrive. It's a gift you can feel great about, because for every $1000 that is spent on gift cards, we'll donate a $100 gift card to one of the RESOLVE families receiving a tree.</p>
